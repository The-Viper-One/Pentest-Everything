# Tickets

### **Supported Methods**

* WMI
* WinRM
* PsExec

### **Known Issues**

Base64 tickets from output are not well formed and requires whitespaces to be removed before being used with tools such as Rubeus.

### Usage

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
# Standard execution
PsMapExec -Username [User] -Password [Pass] -targets [All] -Module Tickets -Method [Method] -ShowOutput
```
{% endcode %}

Output is not returned to the console due to how large this often is and is instead written to  the PME directory which is created in the current working directory.
