## Nmap

As usual we kick off with a nmap scanning using -p- -sS -v switches to quickly scan all ports and show verberose information whilst scanning so we can start enumerating ports before the scan finished.

```
sudo nmap 10.10.237.0 -p- -sS -v

Discovered open port 21/tcp on 10.10.237.0
Discovered open port 139/tcp on 10.10.237.0
Discovered open port 445/tcp on 10.10.237.0
Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.237.0
Discovered open port 1337/tcp on 10.10.237.0

## FTP

Our first discovered port is FTP on TCP 21. I check for anonymous login and find we are allowed access. We have a directory called "pub" and in this we have a .png image file. Opening the file shows nothing interesting apart from the NerdHerd logo.

### Testing for file upload

I tried to upload a file to FTP to see if we had anything here for a potential reverse shell however, we have no permission to perform this.
