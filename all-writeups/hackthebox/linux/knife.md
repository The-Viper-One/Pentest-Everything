# Knife

## Nmap

```
sudo nmap 10.10.10.242 -p- -sS -sV

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.2 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

Port 80 being the only realistic path ahead we view the root page.&#x20;

We find the page is largely unusable. Running `nikto` against the target web server we see very little useful information.

```
nikto -h http://10.10.10.242
```

Running `feroxbuster` against that host we see no interesting found files or directories. However, we are running PHP as per `/index.php.`

Running the web server against ZAP we see HTTP headers return the web server running on `PHP/8.1.0-dev`.

A quick Google search for this version of `PHP` immediately shows exploit code for this version.

From here the first link for exploit-db.com shows us some exploit code and references for the exploit.

**Description**

An early release of PHP, the PHP 8.1.0-dev version was released with a backdoor on March 28th 2021, but the backdoor was quickly discovered and removed. If this version of PHP runs on a server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code by sending the User-Agent header. The following exploit uses the backdoor to provide a pseudo shell on the host.

Running the exploit and the address of the server when prompted gives us a shell as the user james.

Next we notice that in /home/james/.ssh we have id\_rsa files available. We can create an authorized keys file and echo the contents of id\_rsa.pub into the authorized keys file. This will give SSH access without having any knowledge of the user james' password.

```
# Create authorized_keys file
touch authorized_keys

# echo contnets of id_rsa.pub into authorized_keys
echo "<Contents of id_rsa.pub>" > authroized_keys

# Next, copy id_rsa to the attacking system and SSH in as the strapi user.
ssh -i id_rsa james@10.10.10.242
```

Once in by SSH we check `sudo -l` for sudo permissions.

We see we can run the knife binary as the user root without specifying a password. Looking at GTFOBins we see this can be used with `sudo` to escalate privileges.
