After going through all available ports I was unable to enumerate anything interesting...

With no promising avenues for the available ports. We turn to the machine hostname 'ClamAV'. ClamAV is an open source Antivirus solution available here on the vendors website: [https://www.clamav.net/](https://www.clamav.net).

Using `searchsploit` we see an available exploit:

**`Sendmail`**` with clamav-milter < 0.91.2 - Remote Command Execution` (As we know port 25 is open and running Sendmail).

Looking through the exploit code we can see the script will open up port 31337 to receive connections on.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1914).png>)

The script was then executed with the following command.

```
perl clamav.pl 192.168.142.42
```

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1915).png>)

Scanning port 31337 after running the exploit shows it as now being open.

We can then use `netcat` to connect to the port as the root user.

```
nc 192.168.142.42 31337
```

### Metasploit

A module for `Metasploit` exists for this vulnerability.

```
use exploit/unix/smtp/clamav_milter_blackhole
```

The exploit was configured with the options shown below.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1911).png>)

Upon execution we are able to gain root access to the target system.
